SN79489 notes
=============

This is a document to clear up a few inaccuracies regarding this chip,
and also to document everything there is to know about it. Note that
this is written based on tests on a PAL Master System II, and
references are to SMS games. If other systems differ slightly, I won't
know about it.


SN76489 sightings
=================

The SN76489AN discrete chip is used in Sega's SG-1000 Mark I and II,
and SC-3000 machines. I do not know if the Mark III has a discrete chip
or not. The Master System, Game Gear and Mega Drive have it integrated
into their VDPs, for backward compatibility to varying extents.

The Mega Drive "chip" is often referred to as an sn76496. As far as I
am aware, the two are functionally identical since the Mega Drive's is
provided for backward compatibility.

It is written to on all of those machines by writing a byte to port $7f
or, less commonly, $7e.

It is also used as a discrete part on the BBC Micro computer.

The ColecoVision uses it too, probably as a discrete chip as the
ColecoVision has virtually no custom chips. The Coleco Adam presumably
has one too.


SN76489 registers
=================

The SN76489 has 8 "registers" - 4 x 4 bit volume registers, 3 x 10 bit
tone registers and 1 x 4 bit noise register*.

Channel   Volume registers   Tone/noise registers
0 (%00)       Vol0                Tone0
1 (%01)       Vol1                Tone1
2 (%10)       Vol2                Tone2
3 (%11)       Vol3                Noise

* The noise register only uses 3 bits but for descriptive and hardware
  reasons it's 4. The tone registers could also be more likely sizes,
  ie. 16 bits.

All volume registers are initially set to off (%1111), all tone/noise
registers to zero (off/high shift rate periodic noise). The initially
latched register is Tone0. This initialisation may be done by the BIOS
on my SMS2.


SN76489 writes
==============

When a byte is written to the PSG, it processes it as follows:

If bit 7 is 1 then the byte is a LATCH/DATA byte.

  Bits 6 and 5 give the channel to be latched, ALWAYS. This selects the
  row in the above table. Bit 4 determines whether to latch volume (1)
  or tone/noise (0) data - this gives the column.

  The remaining 4 bits are placed into the low 4 bits of the relevant
  register.

> The latched register is NEVER cleared by a data byte. <

If bit 7 is 0 then the byte is a DATA byte.

  If the currently latched register is a tone register then the low 6
  bits of the byte are placed into the high 6 bits of the latched
  register. Otherwise, the low 4 bits are placed into the low 4 bits
  of the relevant register*.

  * How this works is, the 6 bits are written to bits 9 to 4. If a
    register is only 4 bits wide then bits 9 and 8 will map to bits 1
    and 0; bits 7 to 4 will map to bits 3 to 0. This is because the
    high address bits are unconnected when addressing a 4 bit register,
    similarly to the way cart dumps get mirrored - the address is
    modulo by the memory size (9%4=1, 8%4=0, etc). So, when byte
    00abcdef is written to a latched 4 bit register:

      Data   Bit it is   Bit it gets to in    State of register
              sent to    a 4 bit register    after bit is written
        a        9              1                   --a-
        b        8              0                   --ab
        c        7              3                   c-ab
        d        6              2                   cdab
        e        5              1                   cdeb
        f        4              0                   cdef

    It's easier just to test if the latched register is a tone register
    when emulating.


This means that the following data will have the following effect
(spacing added for clarity, hopefully):

1. %1 00 0 1110      Latch, channel 0, tone, data 1110
   %0 0  001111      Data 001111
   Set channel 0 tone to 0011111110 = 0xfe = 440Hz

2. %1 01 1 1111      Latch, channel 1, volume, data 1111
   Set channel 1 volume to 0xf (silent)

3. %1 10 1 1111      Latch, channel 2, volume, data 1111
   %0 0  000000      Data 000000
   Set channel 2 volume to 0xf (silent)
   THEN update it to 0x0 (full)

 > This is different to what other docs tell you. <

4. %1 11 0 0101      Latch, channel 3, noise, data 0101
   Set noise register to (0)101 (white noise, medium shift rate)

5. %1 11 0 0101      Latch, channel 3, noise, data 0101
   %0 0  000100      Data 000100
   Set noise register to (0)101 (white noise, medium shift rate)
   THEN update it to (0)100 (white noise, high shift rate)

 > This is different to what other docs tell you. <

Numbers 1, 2 and 4 above are the same as is described in the various
existing docs.

Number 5 IS USED by some Codemasters games (Micro Machines, Excellent
Dizzy, possibly others). They were written without proper documentation
so they always latch the noise channel with the data bits set to 0,
which gives high shift rate "periodic noise", and write the wanted
settings as a data byte. Emulators which then ignore the data byte will
produce the periodic noise which sounds like a high-pitched "eek"
instead of a drum beat.

Number 3 IS USED - when pausing between text boxes in Alex Kidd in
Miracle World, it is used to silence the sound. Emulators not
supporting this ouput a constant tone instead.

Many games also produce the above two unusual behaviours but not 
repeatedly (often when a SFX is first played, for example).

Also of note is that the tone register updates immediately when the
data byte is written:

  Data written  Tone0 contents
  %1 00 0 0000    %------0000      - signifies an unknown bit
  %0 0  000000    %0000000000      (whatever was previously
  %1 00 0 1111    %0000001111      in the register)
  %0 0  111111    %1111111111

There were a couple of ways to handle PSG writes before:

1. Latch only the tone registers, as above, and leave them latched when
   other types of data (volume, noise) are written. This gives a
   "squawk" effect on Micro Machines' title screen, which drowns out
   the "eek".

2. Latch tone registers as above, and "unlatch" when other types of
   data are written. When a data byte is written with it unlatched, the
   data is discarded. This fixes the "squawk" but leaves the "eek".


How the SN76489 makes sound
===========================

This is already well documented, but I'll repeat it again with
(hopefully) a more hardware-related perspective:

The PSG is connected to the system clock, which is 3579545Hz for NTSC
systems and 3546893Hz for PAL/SECAM systems. It divides this clock by
16 to get its internal clock.

For each channel (all 4) there is a 10 bit counter. Each clock cycle,
the counter is decremented (if it is non-zero). If, after being
decremented, it is zero, the following happens:

1. For tone channels: the counter is reset to the value currently in the
   corresponding register (eg. Tone0 for channel 0). The polarity of
   the output is changed, ie. if it is currently outputting -1 then it
   outputs +1, and vice versa. This output is passed to the mixer (see
   below). The initial output value may be arbitrarily set.

   So, it produces a square wave output with wavelength twice the value
   in the corresponding register (measured in clock ticks). The
   frequency of this can be calculated by

                   Input clock /Hz (3579545)
   Frequency /Hz = -------------------------
                      32 x register value

   so, for example, 0x0fe gives 440Hz.

   If the register value is zero then the output is a constant value of
   +1.

2. For the noise channel: the counter is reset according to the low 2
   bits of the noise register as follows:

   Low 2 bits    Value counter
   of register    is reset to
       00            0x10
       01            0x20
       10            0x40
       11            Tone2

   As with the tone channels, the output changes polarity when it
   reaches zero. However, this is not sent to the mixer, but to a
   "linear feedback shift register" (LFSR), which generates noise.

   The LFSR is an array of 16 bits. When its input shifts from -1 to +1
   (ie. only ONCE for every two times the counter reaches zero), the
   array is shifted by one bit; the direction doesn't matter, it just
   changes what numbers you use, so I will arbitrarily say it shifts
   right. The bit that is shifted off the end is output to the mixer
   (either +1 or 0 - NOT -1).

   The input bit is determined by an linear XOR feedback network. This
   basically means that a certain pattern of bits is "tapped", and the
   bits contained in them (before shifting) are XORed together. This is
   equivalent to calculating the parity of the tapped bits - if there
   are an even number of 1s, the XOR will be 0, and odd number will
   give a result of 1.

   For white noise (Noise register bit 2 = 1):

     For the SMS2, Genesis and Game Gear, the tapped bits are bits 0
     and 3. For the BBC Micro, using John Kortink's data, the tapped
     bits are 15, 2 and 0. I would like to confirm the bit pattern for
     other systems, please contact me if you can help by running/coding
     homebrew code on a real system and sampling the sound.

   For "periodic noise" (Noise register bit 2 = 0):

     Only bit 0 is tapped, ie. the output bit is also the input bit.
     The effect of this is to output the contents of the shift register
     in a 16-bit long loop.

   When the Noise register is written to, the shift register is reset,
   for both my SMS2 and John Kortink's BBC Micro to the value of 0x8000
   (only bit 15 set)*. This will make the "periodic" noise output a
   1/16th duty cycle (15 0s followed by one 1), and is important as it
   affects the sound of white noise.

   * The convention with LFSRs is to reset them with either only one,
     or all but one, bit set.

The mixer then multiplies each channel's output by the corresponding
volume, and sums them. The result is output to an amplifier which
amplifies them to suitable levels for output as audio.


The imperfect SN76489
=====================

Real components aren't perfect. The real SN76489's output is affected
by this.

Wherever a voltage (output) is artificially held away from zero, there
will be leakage and the actual output will decay towards zero at a rate
proportional to the offset from zero:

    dV
    -- = -kV   where k is a constant
    dt

This affects the output from the SN76489.

The effect on the tone channels is to change the shape of their output
waves from this:

---------+         +---------+         +---------+         +---------+
         |         |         |         |         |         |         |
         |         |         |         |         |         |         |

         |         |         |         |         |         |         |
         +---------+         +---------+         +---------+         +--

to something like this:

-__                +-__                +-__                +-__
   ¯¯¯---+         |   ¯¯¯---+         |   ¯¯¯---+         |   ¯¯¯---+
         |         |         |         |         |         |         |
- - - - -|- - - - -|- - - - -|- - - - -|- - - - -|- - - - -|- - - - -|-
         |         |         |         |         |         |         |
         |   ___---+         |   ___---+         |   ___---+         |
         +-¯¯                +-¯¯                +-¯¯                +-¯

If the tone register value is large enough, they will decay close to
zero.

If the tone register value is zero, the constant offset output will
just decay to zero. However, whenever the volume of the output is
changed, the constant offset is restored. This allows speech effects.

The effect on the noise generator's output is this:

Signal generator output, for reference:

----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +--
- - | - -|- - | - -|- - | - -|- - | - -|- - | - -|- - | - -|- - | - -|-
    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+

Perfect output (assuming output bit pattern of 10100101):

---------+         +---------+                   +---------+         +--

- - - - -+---------+- - - - -+-------------------+- - - - -+---------+-

         +-¯¯                +-¯¯                          +-¯¯

The empirical effects are:
- The sound of tones is changed very slightly
- Noise sounds a bit louder
- Voices sound slightly different

Some games were programmed with the PSG considered to be a perfect
device, for example for PCM voice effects.

Note that this effect is very noticeable on the SMS and MD, but not on
the GG (whose speaker quality would have all kinds of effects on the
sound anyway).


Playing samples on the SN76489
==============================

It is possible to do this in two ways:

1. Pulse Width Modulation

   This works by outputting pulses at constant volume whose width and
   spacing gives the effect of different frequencies and volumes. This
   is also how samples are played on PC internal speakers. On the
   SN76489, this is done by:

   1. Setting all 3 tone channels to frequency 0x000
   2. At rapid, closely timed intervals, setting the output volume of
      all 3 to either 0xf (off) or 0x0 (full).

  All three channels are used to get maximum volume.

  PWM is not very good quality (often the sound is unintelligible, for
  example Alex Kidd: the Lost Stars' "Find/I'm the Miracle Ball" and
  Shooting Gallery's "Perfect"), but it is the loudest way to play
  samples.

2. Pulse Code Modulation

   This is the usual way to store and output waves. The desired speaker
   position is stored digitally and the output volume is proportional
   to that. On the SN76489, this is done by:

   1. Setting all 3 tone channels to frequency 0x000
   2. At rapid, closely timed intervals, setting the output volume of
      all 3 to values stored in ROM.

   In other words, the volume setting is used as a 4-bit DAC. Again,
   all three are used together to get maximum volume.

   PCM is better quality, if the wave is well converted to 4 bits per
   sample, but quieter than PWM. It can only sound as good as the
   original 4 bit wave, which is not very high quality to start with.


Game Gear stereo extension
==========================

When a byte is written to port 0x06 on the Game Gear, the PSG output is
affected as follows:

  Bit  Channel
   0      0    -
   1      1     | Right
   2      2     |
   3      3    -
   4      0    -
   5      1     | Left
   6      2     |
   7      3    -

If a bit is set, the corresponding channel is output to the
corresponding side. So, 0xff outputs all channels to all sides, 0xf0
outputs to rhe left side only, etc.
